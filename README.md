# blockly-pddl

Industrialization of automated planning leads to a need to manage the life-cycle of planning models, and quite often the
life cycle will include non-expert users, for whom the verbose logical models in planning languages are not the best
communication instrument.

This is an attempt to bridge the gap using popular drag-and-drop visual framework Blockly, developing an open-source
tool that would seamlessly translate between Problem Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and Blockly.

# How to Use
Go to [ai-planning.github.io/blockly-pddl](https://ai-planning.github.io/blockly-pddl/) and select the desired tool (PDDL, Behavior Trees, or State Machines) from the navigation bar.

# About
## Planning Domain Definition Language
This tool current supports development of PDDL v1.2 domains.
