Industrialization of automated planning leads to a need to manage the life-cycle of planning models, and quite often the
life cycle will include non-expert users, for whom the verbose logical models in planning languages are not the best
communication instrument.

We are attempting to bridge the gap using popular drag-and-drop visual framework Blockly, developing an open-source
tool that would seamlessly translate between Problem Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and Blockly.
