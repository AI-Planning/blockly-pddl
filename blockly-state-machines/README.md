# Introduction 
DFA Studio is a Web-based IDE for non-programmers - such as mechanical engineers - to create and manipulate State Machines (DFA) usable by embedded applications portfolio and beyond.

# Getting Started
1. Try [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) from Google
2. Blockly developer [tools](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html)
3. Blockly JavaScript library [API](https://developers.google.com/blockly/reference/overview)
4. Finite State Machine, [FSM](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/state-machines-basics-of-computer-science-d42855debc66/)
5. FSM [simulator](https://ivanzuzak.info/noam/webapps/fsm_simulator/) with DFA - *deterministic finite automaton* - type of generated FSM
6. [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) exaplained through an example in Python
7. [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) - an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, C#, C, Go, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Lobster, Lua, TypeScript, PHP, Python, Rust and Swift

# Build and Test
Blockly does not require 'build' process, it is Web-based APP. 
Front-end UX and workflow testing is heavily manual.

JS [Unit testing](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/modify/web/unit-testing) confirms the operation of internal JavaScript functions in Blockly's core.
